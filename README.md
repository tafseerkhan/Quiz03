# Quiz03
Quiz 03 for Math 4330 Summer 1 2018

This repository will consist of four files aside from this README 
1)Correct input code for the functions with the last two functions dealing with the Infinity Norm
2)Invalid input which will result in an error code stating that there was an invalid input. Last two functions dealing with Infinity norm
3)Correct input code for the functions with the last two functions dealing with the Euclidean Norm
4)Invalid input which will result in an error code stating that there was an invalid input. Last two functions dealing with Euclidean norm


The objective of this code is to create 5 functions that will find:
  -The dot product between two vectors
  -The difference between two vectors
  -The scalar-vector product
  -The infinity norm of a vector
  -The normalization of a vector
